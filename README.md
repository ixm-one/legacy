IXM is a CMake library for writing Modern *flexible* CMake. This means:

 * Reducing the amount of CMake written
 * Selecting reasonable defaults
 * Supporting hooks and customization points for overriding said defaults
 * Target and Generator Expression focused operations

:warning: IXM currently supports CMake 3.13 as a minimum target. This will
change to CMake 3.14 once released.
