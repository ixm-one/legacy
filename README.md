This is the original alpha release of IXM meant to work with CMake 3.14 and later. However, it never managed to release due to health issues, a pandemic, and burnout. It remains here for posterity. It is still available for use at:

https://legacy.ixm.one

However, this URL will be retired on January 1st, 2023. Attempts to reach this repository via the web afterwards will no longer work.

A newer IXM library targeting CMake 3.24 and later will be available no later than November 1st, 2023 at https://github.com/ixm-one/ixm

<hr>

IXM was a CMake library for writing Modern *flexible* CMake. This means:

 * Reducing the amount of CMake written
 * Selecting reasonable defaults
 * Supporting hooks and customization points for overriding said defaults
 * Target and Generator Expression focused operations
